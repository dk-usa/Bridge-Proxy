# Requirements: LLM Gateway Enhancement

**Defined:** 2026-03-23
**Core Value:** Provide a unified API gateway that abstracts away provider differences and enables enterprise features across multiple LLM providers.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Security

- [x] **SEC-01**: Cache keys are prefixed with tenant_id to prevent cross-tenant data leakage
- [x] **SEC-02**: Cache response validates tenant context before returning data
- [x] **SEC-03**: Tenant isolation test suite validates no cross-tenant access

### Reliability

- [x] **REL-01**: SSE stream sends heartbeat every 15 seconds to prevent connection timeout
- [x] **REL-02**: Infrastructure proxy buffering disabled via X-Accel-Buffering: no header
- [x] **REL-03**: SSE heartbeat configurable via environment variable
- [ ] **REL-04**: Long-running streaming requests (>60s) remain connected

### Observability

- [x] **OBS-01**: Provider health status tracked (healthy/unhealthy/degraded)
- [x] **OBS-02**: Health check endpoint returns provider status for all configured providers
- [x] **OBS-03**: Provider health integrated into admin dashboard UI
- [x] **OBS-04**: Provider health status updates based on recent request success/failure rate

### Smart Caching

- [ ] **CACHE-01**: Semantic cache layer checks embedding similarity before provider call
- [ ] **CACHE-02**: Similarity threshold configurable (default 0.15)
- [ ] **CACHE-03**: Cache hit/miss metrics tracked for semantic cache
- [ ] **CACHE-04**: Semantic cache fallback to exact match when embeddings unavailable

### Universal Bridge Proxy

- [ ] **BRIDGE-01**: Dynamic provider configuration via config file (YAML) and admin API
- [ ] **BRIDGE-02**: Support for 100+ LLM providers through standardized provider adapters
- [ ] **BRIDGE-03**: Virtual key system with per-key budgets, spend tracking, and key rotation
- [ ] **BRIDGE-04**: Sophisticated routing: load balancing, cost-based routing, retry budgets
- [ ] **BRIDGE-05**: Enhanced observability: cost tracking per key/model, fallback frequency, latency histograms

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Security

- **SEC-04**: Timing-safe admin token comparison (crypto.timingSafeEqual)
- **SEC-05**: Atomic budget increments in database transactions
- **SEC-06**: O(1) rate limiting using Redis SCAN/sorted sets

### Reliability

- **REL-05**: Circuit breaker per provider with configurable thresholds
- **REL-06**: Error classification system (retryable vs fail-fast vs fallback)
- **REL-07**: Max fallback depth limit to prevent infinite loops
- **REL-08**: Retry budgets with cost containment

### Observability

- **OBS-05**: Persistent request logs in SQLite
- **OBS-06**: Latency histograms (P50/P95/P99)
- **OBS-07**: Cost tracking per org/team/model
- **OBS-08**: Fallback frequency monitoring

### Smart Routing

- **CACHE-05**: Cost-aware load balancing across providers
- **CACHE-06**: Dynamic provider scoring (latency + cost + quality)
- **CACHE-07**: Provider selection based on request characteristics

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature                  | Reason                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| WebSocket real-time chat | Not needed for API gateway use case   |
| GraphQL API              | REST API sufficient for current needs |
| Mobile SDKs              | Defer to future if demand exists      |
| Prompt playground UI     | Out of scope for gateway service      |
| OAuth login for admin    | Admin token auth sufficient           |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.
